							_________Welcome to My i3 Setup__________

Super Key (Windows Key on Windows and Command Key on Mac) is set as **Mod key**.
That means it is kind of the MAIN key used to perform a lot of actions.
But in reality, we can setup and use any key combinations for any of those actions.

# Start program launcher (rofi)
`Mod + P`

# To set wallpaper
Use the program called nitrogen

# Start a terminal
`Mod + Enter` to open terminal in tiled mode
`Mod + Shift + Enter` to open terminal in floating mode

# Volume Control
`+/-` in `Keypad Section` to Increase/Decrease Volume
`Enter` in `Keypad Section` to Mute Volume
`Insert` in `Keypad Section` to Mute Mic

`Mod + Space` to toggle tiled and floating mode for currently focused window
`Mod + Tab` to change focus between tiled and floating windows
`Mod + Arrow Keys` to change focus to another window of the same type (from tiled to another tiled or from floating to another floating)
`Mod + Shift + Arrow Keys` to move currently focused window around the screen (a minimum of either two tiled windows or one floating floating window is needed for this to work)

# i3wm Control

# Screenshot taking

# Logout - Reboot - Shutdown
`Mod + Shift + Q` and `choose either L, R or S`
